I am a final year Electronic and Information Engineering (computer engineering) student at Imperial College London. I just completed a 6-month placement at a machine learning startup called [Humanising Autonomy](https://humanisingautonomy.com/), working on building object detection systems to better understand humans. I'm very interested in doing research in deep learning and generative models that learn generalisable representations. I plan on doing a PhD in this field after finishing my Master's in 2023.

**Research:** Over the last year, I've been working on a research problem involving inpainting satellite images within a meta-learning framework. See the [project page](/projects/convnp/) and [paper under review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12407). I've been working with a great team of other Imperial students supervised by [Harrison Zhu](https://harrisonzhu508.github.io/).

**Experience:** During my placement at Humanising Autonomy, I worked on implementing active learning approaches that find the key frames in videos to be labelled and used for training object detection models in a more data-efficient manner. I then built an automated data ingestion pipeline in AWS, which efficiently gets frames from client videos without human intervention. I also worked on improving the smoothness of object tracking, writing production level Python code and developed a reproducible way of creating demos of the pose estimation and object detection systems on the edge.

I was also previously a software engineering intern at MathWorks, where I worked on the [MATLAB Deep Learning Toolbox](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/deep-learning.html). This was a unique experience to code machine learning tools rather than just using them out-of-the-box. I developed a video action recognition classifier based on a research paper in order to demonstrate new functionality in the toolbox and enhanced the pooling layers used in neural networks to allow spatiotemporal operations.
