I am a 3rd year Electronic and Information Engineering (computer engineering) student at Imperial College London. Currently doing a 6-month placement at a machine learning startup called [Humanising Autonomy](https://humanisingautonomy.com/), working on building object detection systems to better understand humans. I'm very interested in doing research in deep learning and generative models. I plan on doing a PhD in this field after finishing my Master's next year (2023).

**Research:** Over the last year, I've been working on a research problem involving inpainting satellite images within a meta-learning framework. See the project page and [paper under review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12407). I've been working with a great team of other Imperial students supervised by [Harrison Zhu](https://harrisonzhu508.github.io/).

**Experience:** I was a software engineering intern at MathWorks, where I worked on the [MATLAB Deep Learning Toolbox](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/deep-learning.html). I developed a video action recognition classifier implementation based on a research paper and enhanced pooling layers to allow spatiotemporal operations.

My current placement has involved work on implementing active learning approaches and deploying automated data ingestion pipelines using AWS.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
